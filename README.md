   - member_id (INT, Primary Key)
   - name (VARCHAR)
   - email (VARCHAR)

âš™ **Installation & Setup**

1. Install MySQL on your system.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open the project folder in your terminal or PowerShell.
4. Run the PowerShell script to set up the database:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run-sql.ps1
   ```
5. This will create the database, import the schema, insert sample data, and run queries.

ðŸ“– **Usage**

After setting up the database, you can:
- View all members, books, and exchanges.
- Add new members or books.

```sql
-- View all members
SELECT * FROM members;
